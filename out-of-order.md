# Chromacity Breakage FAQ

## What happened to the color picker!?

**It broke.**  Hard.  DeviantART updated one of the things on their website, a library named jQuery, and this broke the color picker I used.

## So what now?

What happens now is that **I will make my own color picker**.  Honestly, I'd been meaning to do this for a long time, for various reasons, namely the terrible code it forced me to write, and the license it was released under (for more info, see notes).

**This may take a few weeks** â€” a lot of math will be involved, as well as some photoshop work, and rendering that color wheel is a lot harder than it looks!

## What do we do for now?

Since you're reading this, I assume you've installed the initial release version of Chromacity 2.0.0.  In this version, I've fixed the hex inputs, torn out the old color picker, and provided a link to an online color picker which I invite you to use.


# Notes

## License

All my code is released under the MIT License, an incredibly loose license, which grants a lot of freedoms; the color picker, on the other hand, is released under the GNU GPL license, which is much stricter and technically not compatible.
